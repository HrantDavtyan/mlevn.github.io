## How to add and edit content
GitHub Pages uses [**Markdown**](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for basic styling without using HTML.

To add to or edit the content, just **create or edit a file** in the [github.com/MLEVN/mlevn.github.io](https://github.com/MLEVN/mlevn.github.io) repo and then [**create a pull request**](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).  You can also click *Edit on GitHub* at the bottom of any page. 

Once we accept the pull request your changes will appear on mlevn.org.

## How to post to the community

We use Reddit as the forum for our community.  In [/r/MLEVN](https://reddit.com/r/mlevn) click [Submit a link](https://www.reddit.com/r/MLEVN/submit) (classic) or [Create post](https://new.reddit.com/r/MLEVN/submit) (new) to submit a link, media file or text.

After submitting a post you can flair it with the appropriate topic tags so that other members can easily find it in search results.

Text and comments on Reddit also suppot Markdown, like GitHub Pages.

Top posts to /r/MLEVN are automatically piped to our [Twitter page](https://twitter.com/ML_EVN) and [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/MLEVN.org/).  The title is copied verbatim, so if you use a URL or @username in the title it will be hyperlinked in the post on those platforms.
