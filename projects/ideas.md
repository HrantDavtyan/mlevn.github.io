## Neuron deletion for sentence classification

There is a paper by Deepmind [1] about the stability of a trained large ConvNet when removing some of its neurons (Fig. 1). 
They also showed that there is a correlation between generalization and robustness (Fig. 3b).

* Choose a sentence classification task, train a few (different) types of networks. Could be one academic task + one task from industry
* Generate Figure 1 for these networks (without label noise) 
* Generate Figure 3b for these networks, look for clusters
* Investigate if robustness can be used as an early stopping signal (Figure 4)
* Investigate the role of dropout / recurrent dropout, compare with ConvNet results (Figure 5a)
* (harder) Investigate the role of recurrent batch-norm (Figure 5b)
